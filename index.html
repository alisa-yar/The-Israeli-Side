            <h1>The Israeli side</h1>
            <h2>Of the Israel-Palestine conflict</h2>
            <h3>Hamas</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><mark>Gaza is not under Israeli authority, and Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.</mark></li>
                <li>Palestinians chose Hamas as their authority and leadership, and Hamas decided to spend their money on weapons instead of building schools.</li>
                <li>Hamas never attempted to take control of their own utilities in order to provide for their people. Gazans elected a government that chose to spend on weapons rather than energy and water. 
                    <mark>Gazans destroyed their own infrastructure that was built by Israel when the Israelis left it to them.</mark> 
                    Hamas, the elected Gazan government, chooses to use food to make rocket fuel rather than feed their people.
                </li>
                <li><mark>Gaza is being funded by the billions.</mark> 
                    They are not poor; they are rich. They could live their best lives in Gaza, build hotels on the beaches, and build the land, parks, neighbourhoods, shopping malls, etc. 
                    <mark>Instead, all the money goes to weapons and terror tunnels. WHILE the heads of hamas ARE WORTH BILLIONS!!</mark> 
                    Yes, the heads of Hamas are billionaires. Ismail Haniyeh and Khaled Mashal are Gazan citizens, heads of hamas, and billionaires. With a B. There are only 3,000 billionaires in the world. 
                    So yeah, all the sadaqah being sent by Muslims world-wide to support Gaza goes to their pockets, while they own real estate all over the world, live in London while their children get top-notch education, and fuel poor Gaza people with hate and weapons so they will die in war for more marketing materials to keep that business running.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Israel “occupies” or "oppress" Gaza</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><mark>Gaza HAD the ability to be self sufficient at one point, but they tore up the infrastructure to make missiles.</mark> 
                    Seriously, you can find photos online of them digging up a series of water mains the EU paid to be put in so they can turn the sections into homemade missiles. 
                    There's an aquifer under Gaza but they ruined it with sewage contamination. Their power plant problems are similar. 
                    They could have used the billions they get every year to stockpile fuel for the plant, or they could have built renewable energy sources, but that money went to terrorist infrastructure and missiles and paid for slaying. 
                    There's also actually an airport in Gaza, but the runway was bombed in 2001. 
                    They could have fixed it with all the concrete the UN gives them, but they made tunnels instead.
                </li>
                <li>The residents of Gaza could have the ability to travel freely and have unrestricted import and export; 
                    the problem is that they would not use it to better their lives but to make more weapons and kill more Israeli civilians.
                </li>
                <li><mark>Israel doesn't even want to control Gaza. It's a burden and a punishment,</mark> 
                    but Israel does it out of necessity because we want to live.
                </li>
                <li><mark>The only control Israel has is AROUND Gaza, not INSIDE it.</mark> 
                    They could have built their own much-wanted country, but they chose not to. Is it really too much to ask to not butcher Jews?
                </li>
                <li>Gaza is ruled by Hamas; in a prison camp, you are controlled by the guards who are there by the state, 
                    <mark>so yes, they are in a prison camp made by Hamas, not Israel.</mark> 
                    Hence, the analogy that Israel imprisons them falls short.
                    It is a prison squarely in the sense that Israel closes the border, which is what any country does, has done, and will do to another nation (de facto) they are at war with (de facto and now official).
                    The only difference is that in this case, Israel is the only bordering country, so it traps Palestinians.
                    <mark>Except for Egypt, who also keep the border shut and have even more extreme methods of policing than Israel, such as gassing underground tunnels,</mark> 
                    because Gaza is run by terrorists who Egypt also doesn't want to have open access to their country because they know Hammas are animals and they don't want terrorists in Egypt either.
                    <mark>Israel has not occupied Gaza and has had no forces there for over two decades.</mark> 
                    Even after unilaterally pulling out and granting Gaza self-rule alongside ownership of all infrastructure in Gaza, the terror attacks have only worsened. 
                    Hammas only wants war, and every time Israel has tried talks for peace, the Palestinians spit in their faces and commit even more terror attacks.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Israel Attacks</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Any time Israel attacked Gaza, it had specific aims that were Hamas bases or related.</li>
                <li><mark>Hamas targets civilians deliberately. Israel targets military targets, and civilian casualties are an unfortunate byproduct.</mark> 
                    There is a huge difference between those two.
                </li>
                <li>Again, there is a big difference between collateral and targeting children.</li>
                <li>If someone is weaker and poorer, they aren't necessarily morally righteous. Being angry is not the same as being innocent.</li>
                <li>The fact that the Palestinians are "weaker" doesn't mean that they are the oppressed ones.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Utilities</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Israel is under no obligation to provide them with utilities in this situation. 
                    They were under obligation to do so because of the Oslo accords, which Hamas has violated time and again. Israel didn't put them in this situation; Hamas did. 
                    Israel has every right to defend itself. There was no blockade for 18 months following the pullout until Hamas made their intentions clear. 
                    Also, Egypt has the very same blockade in effect.
                </li>
                <li>There's footage of Hamas actually cutting off Palestinian water pipes to build rockets with them.</li>
                <li>Israel isn't blocking access; it's simply not providing it.</li>
                <li>The water and electricity they were providing at no cost are no longer being provided. You know, because that territory just sent over 1500 terrorists across the border to rape and murder Jews.</li>
                <li><mark>The UN invested millions in infrastructure for water systems in Gaza. Hamas took those water pipes and made rockets out of them.</mark> 
                    Israel also moved materials and tools into Gaza for the purpose of building new neighbourhoods. 
                    How do you think the bulldozer that breached the fence got into Gaza in the first place? 
                    Israel gave it to Gaza in good faith for construction use. You simply cannot invest in infrastructure in the region while Hamas rules over Gaza or even exists on this earth. 
                    The claimed aim of the Israeli initiative as of this moment is the complete destruction of Hamas. Many Palestinian civilians are paying the price, and I have no doubt in my mind that Hamas higher-ups anticipated this. 
                    That is exactly why they're not in Gaza right now; they're in Qatar ordering another martini and watching the fireworks. Let me be very clear here: civilian lives being lost is a tragedy, and if you're looking for a bad guy here to point fingers at, that would be Hamas. 
                    Also, what about the PA? Why haven't they made an announcement condemning Hamas' actions? 
                    Perhaps Hamas has more support from the Palestinian people than we think...
                </li>
                <li>They weren't always blockaded. In 2008, Israel and Egypt decided together to do that after terrorist attacks in Israel and the Sinai, more than two years after Israel pulled out of Gaza.</li>
                <li><mark>Israel provides aid to a nation trying to destroy it. Just not during an active war. Gaza has its own sources of water, food, and energy controlled by Hamas. If it's not sufficient, then that's the real issue, and the issue is with Hamas and its corrupt leadership.</mark>
                    Hamas chooses bombs and personal funds for itself over feeding and caring for its constituents. It diverts global aid to enrich its hierarchy.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Casualties</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><mark>Hamas shoots its rockets from schools or areas where there are a lot of kids and families. Why? because they couldn't care less about human lives, and they know that Israel wants to minimise the casualties.</mark></li>
                <li>How can Israel protect itself from terrorists without killing innocents when Hamas literally hides behind these innocent children while firing rockets on a daily basis into Israel? It's actually a win-win situation for them because afterwards they can film these casualties and say that Israel targets innocent children.</li>
                <li><mark>It's a war crime to set up military operations among civilians in order to use them as human shields</mark> to prevent an attack on them.</li>
                <li>Israel could turn Gaza into a parking lot within the hour. It's doesn't. Palestinians don't flee because Egypt and Jordan have been very clear: they're not welcome. 
                    The US is currently trying to get Egypt to establish a humanitarian zone. Nobody's bombing it. Israel warns them every time. 
                    This time, no warning was needed. Gloves are off. The way it should be. Your terrorist government massacred babies, women, and children. You know what to expect. Act accordingly.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>"Genocide"</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><mark>It's called war. A war Israel didn't start.</mark> 
                    Feel free to name one country that, if brutally and repeatedly attacked by a genocidal fascist ethnic state next door, wouldn't respond.
                </li>
                <li><mark>There were only 250k people when they got to the Gaza strip,</mark> 
                    which does not include the rest of the Palestinians living inside Israel.
                </li>
                <li>Isreal isn't doing a very good job of this whole genocide thing, if that's been the aim. 
                    <mark>Palestine's population has more than doubled since the 1990s.</mark> 
                    Their population growth rate today is 32% higher than Israel's growth rate. Even halfway through this year, it grew by 300,000.
                </li>
                <!-- <li>Israel did not steal this territory. It was a demilitarized area ruled by the Turkish, then by the English. The Arabs that were in this territory were Egyptians, Lebanese, Jordanian, Syrian.. Jews were also here (since the biblical story). Building the kibuts, farms, coffee shops and restaurants, they had their newspaper etc. The right to build a Jewish state was given after the haulocost, some of the land was purchased with money.</li> -->
                <li>Just because Israel has a better success rate at defending its citizens doesn't mean genocide.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>"Peace"</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Israel tried too many times to make peace, but every single time they refused. 
                    <mark>We offered a two-state solution 4 times.</mark>
                </li>
                <li>Israel was dragged into a war that they won, and now they have to give the losers of that war what they want? 
                    If you challenge someone to a war and lose, then the winners still offer you land, and you still refuse. Maybe stop pretending it's just about land.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Why Does Egypt Refuse to Open Their Border?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There's a reason why Egypt closed its border and didn't let Palestinians enter the country. 
                    It's because Palestinians kept causing terror attacks in Egypt as well, and they agree with Israel that Palestinians cannot be trusted and that letting them in will backfire
                </li>
                <li><mark>1970, Black September Jordan accepts Palestinian refugees. Refugees attempt to conquer Jordan</mark> 
                    with Syria's help. Palestinians lose and return to the West Bank.
                </li>
                <li><mark>1975: Lebanese Civil War After being expelled from Jordan, Palestinians take refuge in Lebanon and promptly join a civil war against Lebanese Christians, including a massacre.</mark> 
                    Are eventually expelled in the 1991 Battle of Sidon.
                </li>
                <li><mark>Hamas is a splinter group from the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood,</mark> 
                    a militant Islamist party that repeatedly tried to overthrow the Egyptian government.
                    Egypt has banned the Brotherhood, considers them a terrorist organisation, and wants nothing to do with Hamas.
