            <h1>The Israeli side</h1>
            <h2>Of the Israel-Palestine conflict</h2>
            <h3>Hamas</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Gaza is not under Israel authority and Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.</li>
                <li>Palestinians chose Hamas as their authority and leadership and Hamas decided to spend their money on weapons instead on building schools.</li>
                <li>Hamas never ever attempted to take control of their own utilities in order to provide for their people. Gazans elected a government that chose to spend for weapons rather than energy and water. Gazans DESTROYED their own infrastructure that was built by Israel when Israelis left it to them. Hamas, the elected Gazans government, CHOOSES to use food to make rocket fuel rather than feed their people.</li>
                <li>Gaza is being funded by the BILLIONS. They are not poor, they are rich AF. They could live their best lives in Gaza, build hotels on the beaches, and build the land, parks, neighborhoods, shopping malls etc. Instead all the money goes to weapons and terror tunnels. WHILE the heads of hamas ARE WORTH BILLIONS!! Yes, the head of hamas are billionaires. Ismail Haniyeh and Khaled Mashal are Gaza citizens, head of hamas and are billionaires. With a B. There are only 3000 billionaires in the world. So yeah all the sadaqah being sent by Muslims world wide to support Gaza goes to their pockets, while they own real estate all over the world, living in London while their childrens gets top notch education, and fueling poor Gaza people with hate and weapon so they will die in war for more marketing materials to keep that buisness running.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Israel “occupies” or "oppress" Gaza</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Gaza HAD the ability to be self sufficient at one point, but they tore up the infrastructure to make missiles. Seriously, you can find photos online of them digging up a series of water mains the EU paid to be put in so they can turn the sections into homemade missiles. There's an aquifer under Gaza but they ruined it with sewage contamination. Their power plant problems are similar. They could have used the billions they get every year to stockpile fuel for the plant, or they could have built renewable energy sources, but that money went to terrorist infrastructure and missiles and pay for slay. There’s also actually an airport in Gaza but the runway was bombed in 2001. They could have fixed it with all the concrete the UN gives them but they made tunnels instead.</li>
                <li>The residents of Gaza could have the ability to travel freely and have unrestricted import and export, the problem is that they would not use it to better their lives, but to make more weapons and kill more Israeli civilians.</li>
                <li>Israel doesn't even want to control Gaza, It's a burden and a punishment, but Israel does it out of necassity because we want to live.</li>
                <li>The only control Israel has is AROUND Gaza, not INSIDE it. They could have built their own much wanted country, they chose not to, is it really too much to ask to not butcher Jews?!</li>
                <li>Gaza is ruled by Hamas, in a prison camp you are controlled by the guards who are there by the state, so yes they are in a prison camp, made by Hammas not Israel. hence the analogy that Israel imprisons them falls short.
                    It is a prison squarely in the sense that Israel closes the border.... which is what any country does, has done and will do to another nation (de facto) they are at war with (de facto and now official).
                    The only difference is that in this case Israel is the only bordering country and so it traps Palestinians in. Except for Egypt, who also keep the border shut and have even more extreme methods of policing than Israel of gassing underground tunnels, because Gaza is run by terrorists who Egypt also don't want having open access into their country, because they know Hammas are animals and they dont want terrorist in Egypt either.
                    Israel does not occupy Gaza and has no forces there for over 2 decades. Even after unilaterally pulling out and granting Gaza self rule alongside ownership of all infrastructure in Gaza, the terror attacks have only worsened.
                    Hammas only wants war , and evey time Israel has tried talks for peace the Palestinians spit in their face, and commit more terrorist attacks.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Israel Attacks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Any time Israel attacked Gaza, it was specific aims that are Hamas bases or related.</li>
                <li>Hamas targets civilians deliberately. It is their reason for being. Israel targets military targets and civilian casualties are an unfortunate byproduct. There is a huge difference between those two.</li>
                <li>Again, There is a big difference between collateral and targeting children.</li>
                <li>If someone is weaker and poorer they aren't necessary morally righteous. Being angry is not the same as being innocent.</li>
                <li>The fact that the Palestinians are "weaker" doesn't mean that they are the oppressed ones.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Utilities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Israel is under no obligation to provide them utilities in this situation. They were under obligation to do so because of the Oslo accords which Hamas has violated (time and again). Israel didn't put them in this situation, Hamas did. Israel has every right to defend itself. There was no blockade for 18 months following the pull out until Hamas made their intentions clear. Also Egypt has the very same blockade in effect.</li>
                <li>There's a footage of Hamas actually cutting off Palestinian water pipes to build rockets with them.</li>
                <li>Israel isn't not blocking access, it's simply not providing it.</li>
                <li>The water and electricity they were providing at no cost is no longer being provided. You know, because that territory just sent over 1500 terrorists across the border to rape and murder Jews.</li>
                <li>The UN invested millions in infrastructure for water systems in Gaza. Hamas took those water pipes and made rockets out of them. Israel also moved materials and tools into Gaza for the use of building new neighborhoods, how do you think the bulldozer that breached the fence got into Gaza in the first place? Israel gave it to Gaza in good faith for construction use.
                    you simply cannot invest in infrastructure in the region while Hamas rules over gaza, or even exists on this earth.
                    The claimed aim of the Israeli initiative as of this moment, is the complete destruction of Hamas. many Palestinian civilians are paying the price, and I have no doubt in my mind that Hamas higher-ups anticipated this. that is exactly why they're not in Gaza right now, they're in Qatar ordering another martini watching the fireworks.
                    let me be very clear here, civilian lives being lost is a tragedy, and if you're looking for a bad guy here to point fingers at, that would be Hamas. Also what about the PA? why haven't they gone on an announcement condemning Hamas' actions? perhaps Hamas has more support from the Palestinian people than we think...
                </li>
                <li>They also weren’t always blockaded. In 2008 Israel and Egypt decided together to do that after terrorist attacks in Israel and the Sinai, more than two years after Israel pulled out of Gaza.</li>
                <li>Israel provides aid to a nation trying to destroy it. Just not during active war. Gaza has its own sources of water, food, energy controlled by Hamas. If it's not sufficient, then that's the real issue, and the issue is with Hamas, and its corrupt leadership.
                    Hamas chooses bombs, and personal funds for itself over feeding and caring for its constituents. It diverts global aid to enrich its hierarchy.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Casualties</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hamas shoots its rockets from schools or areas where there are a lot of kids and families. Why? because they couldn't care less about human lives and they know that Israel wants to minimize the casualties.</li>
                <li>How can Israel protect itself from terrorists without killing innocent when Hamas literally hides behind these innocent children while firing rockets on a daily basis into Israel? It's actually a win-win situation for them because afterwards they can film these casualties and tell that Israel targets innocent children.</li>
                <li>It's a war crime to setup military operations among civilians in order to use them as human shields in order to prevent an attack on them.</li>
                <li>Israel could turn Gaza into a parking lot within the hour. It’s not. Palestinians don’t flee because Egypt and Jordan have been very clear, they’re not welcome. The information you’re getting does not purport with reality. The US is currently trying to get Egypt to establish a humanitarian zone. Nobody’s bombing the exists. Israel warns them every time. This time no warning was needed. Gloves are off. The way it should be. Your terrorist government massacred babies, women, children… you know what to expect. Act accordingly.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>"Genocide"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It's called war. A war Israel didn't start. Feel free to name one country that if brutally and repeatedly attacked by a genocidal fascist ethnic state next door wouldn't respond.</li>
                <li>There were only 250k people when they got to the Gaza strip, which does not include the rest of the Palestinian living inside Israel.</li>
                <li>Isreal isn't doing a very good job of this whole genocide thing if that's been the aim. Palestines population has more than doubled since the 90s. Their population growth rate today is 32% higher than Israel's growth rate. Even halfway through this year, it grew 300k.</li>
                <!-- <li>Israel did not steal this territory. It was a demilitarized area ruled by the Turkish, then by the English. The Arabs that were in this territory were Egyptians, Lebanese, Jordanian, Syrian.. Jews were also here (since the biblical story). Building the kibuts, farms, coffee shops and restaurants, they had their newspaper etc. The right to build a Jewish state was given after the haulocost, some of the land was purchased with money.</li> -->
                <li>Just because israel has a better success rate at defending their citizens doesn't mean genocide.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>"Peace"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Israel tried too many times to make peace, but every single time they refused. We offered a two state solution 4 times.</li>
                <li>Israel was dragged into a war that they won and now they have to give the losers of that war what they want? If you challenge someone to a war... lose.. then the winners still offer you land.. and you still refuse... maybe stop pretending it's iust about land.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Why Egypt Refuse Opening Their Border?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>There's a reason why Egypt closed their border and don't let the Palestinians enter the country. It's because Palestinians kept causing terror attacks in Egypt as well, and they agree with Israel that Palestinians cannot be trusted and that letting them in will backfire.</li>
                <li>1970 Black September. Jordan accepts Palestinian refugees. Refugees attempt to conquer Jordan, with Syria’s help. Palestinians lose, return to West Bank.</li>
                <li>1975 Lebanese Civil War. After being expelled from Jordan, Palestinians take refuge in Lebanon, promptly join a civil war against Lebanese Christians, including a massacre. Are eventually expelled in the 1991 Battle of Sidon.</li>
                <li>Hamas is a splinter group from the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, a militant Islamist party that repeatedly tried to overthrow the Egyptian government. Egypt has banned the brotherhood and considers them a terrorist organization, wants nothing to do with Hamas.</li>
            </ul>
