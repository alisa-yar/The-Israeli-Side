            <h1>Gaza</h1>
            <h2>Hamas</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gaza is not under Israel authority and Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.</li>
                <li>Palestinians chose Hamas as their authority and leadership and Hamas decided to spend their money on weapons instead on building schools.</li>
                <li>Hamas never ever attempted to take control of their own utilities in order to provide for their people. Gazans elected a government that chose to spend for weapons rather than energy and water. Gazans DESTROYED their own infrastructure that was built by Israel when Israelis left it to them. Hamas, the elected Gazans government, CHOOSES to use food to make rocket fuel rather than feed their people.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Israel Attacks</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Any time Israel attacked Gaza, it was specific aims that are Hamas bases or related.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Casualties</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Hamas shoots its rockets from schools or areas where there are a lot of kids and families. Why? because they couldn't care less about human lives and they know that Israel wants to minimize the casualties.</li>
                <li>How can Israel protect itself from terrorists without killing innocent when Hamas literally hides behind these innocent children while firing rockets on a daily basis into Israel? It's actually a win-win situation for them because afterwards they can film these casualties and tell that Israel targets innocent children.</li>
                <li>It's a war crime to setup military operations among civilians in order to use them as human shields in order to prevent an attack on them.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Egypt Border</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>There's a reason why Egypt closed their border and don't let the Palestinians enter the country. It's because Palestinians kept causing terror attacks in Egypt as well, and they agree with Israel that Palestinians cannot be trusted and that letting them in will backfire.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Utilities</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Israel is under no obligation to provide them utilities in this situation. They were under obligation to do so because of the Oslo accords which Hamas has violated (time and again). Israel didn’t put them in this situation, Hamas did. Israel has every right to defend itself. There was no blockade for 18 months following the pull out until Hamas made their intentions clear. Also Egypt has the very same blockade in effect.</li>
                <li>There's a footage of Hamas actually cutting off Palestinian water pipes to build rockets with them.</li>
                <li>Israel isn't not blocking access, it's simply not providing it.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Israel “occupies” Gaza</h2>
            <ol>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
